# Mini Kite Mode

Emacs integration for WebKit remote debug protocol. Inspired by [Kite][kite]
and [Wooky][wooky].

Debugging JavaScript in WebKit browser (Chrome) from Emacs is always fun.
There's a couple of packages implement that idea already [Skewer][skewer],
[Kite][kite] and [Wooky][wooky] with different feature set. However, due
to my specific workflow and needs, they are not suitable, so I decided to
wrote this.

* Skewer: I don't fell like injecting a custom script or running a web
  server within Emacs. Also the simple evaluation requires JavaScript
  to be structured in a specific way and doesn't employ the WebKit
  Debuger's power (.i.e redefine closure).
* Kite: Is huge and full featured, but I don't need debugging, it is better
  suit for something like [realgud][realgud].
* Wooky: sounds perfect for me, except it doesn't support redefining closure.
